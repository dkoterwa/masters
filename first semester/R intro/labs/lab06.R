### Data from different sources ################################################


# Absolute path, basic functions:


# file location

# Windows path: C:\Users\maria\Desktop\RIntro\data\notepadData.txt

# transformation1: C:\\Users\\maria\\Desktop\\RIntro\\data\\notepadData.txt

# transformation2: C:/Users/maria/Desktop/RIntro/data/notepadData.txt


# Reading data from txt file with basic function read.table

# checking the arguments of the function
?read.table
setwd('/Volumes/Macintosh HD – dane/GitHub/masters/first semester/R intro/data')
table1 <- read.table("notepadData.txt", 
                     header = TRUE, sep = " ")

table1

# now we can use the data we have read
summary(table1$price)



# reading data with relative paths

# path to the data folder:  "C:/Users/maria/Desktop/RIntro/data"

# setting the 'working directory' 
setwd("C:/Users/maria/Desktop/RIntro/data")

# checking the path to the working directory 
getwd()


# location can be stored with a text variable which stores the path to the folder
locationWD <- c("C:/Users/maria/Desktop/RIntro")

setwd(locationWD)

getwd() # we get the same result



# now we can use the relative paths:

table1a <- read.table("notepadData.txt", 
                      header = TRUE, sep = " ")

table1a # success! the same table has been read



# path location can be chosen with the interactive function file.choose()

table1b <- read.table(file.choose(), header = TRUE, sep = " ")
table1b



### Reading data of other types ################################################

# reading the csv file with read.csv() function

water <- read.csv("dataset - water quality/water_potability.csv", sep = ";", dec=".")

# good practice! always glimpse at the data that you have just read
# check if they are read in the proper format 
head(water)

# Problem! there was a wrong separator chosen 

water <- read.csv("graphics - water quality/water_potability.csv", sep = ",", dec=".")

head(water) # now the data looks properly



# reading data from Excel file with read_excel function

# staring with installing the new package
install.packages("readxl")

# loading it to the current R session
# now its functions will be available in this R session
library(readxl)

?read_excel

# automatic loading of the first sheet

loanEXCEL3

class(loanEXCEL1) # to tibble - specific data types, extending the data.frame possibilities

loanEXCEL1 <- as.data.frame(loanEXCEL1)
class(loanEXCEL1)

# cleaning the environment from unnecessary files - function remove()
remove(loanEXCEL3)
loanEXCEL3 # reading error: this object is no longer available in the memory



### Saving and reading R objects ###############################################

# Saving and reading objects between R sessions 

ls() # listing all the objects loaded in the memory 

# saving all loaded objects to the file (to use them in the next session)
save(list = ls(all.names = TRUE), file= "data/all.rda")

rm(list = ls(all.names = TRUE)) # cleaning the whole memory

loanEXCEL1 # lack of object

load("data/all.rda")

loanEXCEL1 # object read again 

# saving single object to a file  
save(loanEXCEL1, file = "data/loanEXCEL_inR.rda")

rm(loanEXCEL1)

head(loanEXCEL1)

load("data/loanEXCEL_inR.rda")

head(loanEXCEL1)

# saving a few objects -> to the RData file
save(loanEXCEL1, loanEXCEL2, file = "data/loanEXCEL12_inR.RData")
load("data/loanEXCEL12_inR.RData")


rm(list = ls(all.names = TRUE)) # cleaning the enviroment

### Tasks ######################################################################
library(readxl)
# 1. read the description of the clients' personality analysis data and load it 
# into R (clients.csv file) as a variable named "clients". 
clients = read.csv('clients.csv')
# 2. preview the structure of the data and check what classes have been assigned 
# to the variables in question.

# 3. Check if there are any missing observations in the set. 
nrow(clients[!complete.cases(clients), ])
# a) Which variables include missing values?
na_count <-sapply(clients, function(y) sum(length(which(is.na(y)))))
na_count

# b) Input the missing values with the mean or median value from the variable. 
clients$Year_Birth[is.na(clients$Year_Birth)] <- median(clients$Year_Birth, na.rm = TRUE)
clients$MntWines[is.na(clients$MntWines)] <- mean(clients$MntWines, na.rm = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
clients = drop_na(clients)
# Before completing the values, consider what values the variable takes. 
# If they are numbers, are they integers (e.g. year of birth)? If so, complete 
# these values according to the nature of the variable (we don't want the year 
# 1995.832, do we? ;)).
# c) What code do you use to fill the missing values of Year_Birth (if any)?
clients$Year_Birth[is.na(clients$Year_Birth)] <- median(clients$Year_Birth, na.rm = TRUE)
# 4. a) Check that all missing observations have been completed. If not, repeat step 3. 
# b) What code would you use to show all the rows which still have some missing data?
clients$MntWines[is.na(clients$MntWines)] <- mean(clients$MntWines, na.rm = TRUE)
# 5. a) Consider which variables are worth converting to a "factor" type? 
# Hint: these will usually be text variables with a few specific, recurring 
# values. They can also be variables that are represented by numbers, but do 
# not have a "numerical sense" - e.g. the variable "education" and the values 
# 2, 3, 4, which actually represent successive stages of education (logical sense) 
# rather than the exact number of years of education (numerical sense). 
# b) What code would you use to transform the Marital_Status variable (shortest code possible)?

# 6. a) Consider which of the previously identified variables would be worth 
# converting to an 'ordered factor' type (ordered categorical variable).
# Hint: An 'ordered factor' type variable should contain a logical order of 
# levels - e.g. an 'education' variable with values of 'primary', 'secondary' 
# and 'tertiary'. In this case, it may be worthwhile to keep the different 
# levels in order. Another typical example of an ordered factor variable is survey 
# responses recorded using a Likert scale (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale). 
# b) What code would you use to transform the Education variable? Let's assume that 
# 2n means secondary education and graduation is equal to BA defence.

# 7. Transform the variables identified in steps 5 and 6 into the appropriate classes.

# 8. Save results for future reference! Use an RData file with name "clientsInR".
