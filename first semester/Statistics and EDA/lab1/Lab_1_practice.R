#What is the probability that the consumers are younger than 40?
#What is the share of the consumers that are younger than 40?

#Exercise 2: Binomial distribution
#Calculate the probablity of obtaining 0 heads in 4 coin tossing.
#We have k=0 successes in 4 trials in which p=1/2
dbinom(0, 4, 0.5)

#What are the chances of receiving more than 3 heads in 4 coin tossing?
#we can derive the whole distribution
#there are 4 trials, so the number of successes can be: 0,1,2,3,4 and 
#the respective probabilities are:
probs <-  dbinom(0:4, 4, 0.5)
data.frame(0:4, probs) 

#we can also calculate cdf at 3
1-pbinom(3, 4, 0.5)
#or cdf for each value
cdf <- pbinom(0:4, 4, 0.5)
data.frame(0:4, cdf) 


#Exercise 3: Poisson distribution
#Consider a population of raisin buns for which there are an average of
#3 raisins per bun, i.e. lambda = 3. The number of raisins in
#a particular bun is uncertain; the possible numbers of raisins are 0, 1, 2, . . .
#Calculate the probability of finding exactly 2 raisins in a bun. 
#What are the chances of finding more than 3 raisins in a bun?

#Probability of finding exactly 2 raisins in a bun
#We need to calculate the probability that exactly k=2 events occur in a bun, 
#when we know that on average there are 3 raisins in a bun (lambda=3)
dpois(2, 3)
ppois(3,3)
1 - ppois(3,3)
?ppois
#Probability of finding more than 3 raisins in the bun
#We need to calculate the probability that we find more than 3 raisins, i.e. 4,5,6, .... 
#It is easier to calculate the probability of finding at most 3 raisins and substract it from 1 

#Let's calculate the probability that we find at most 3 raisins, i.e. 0,1,2,or 3 raisins
#We can do that by calculating cdf at 3
ppois(3, 3) -> a
#then the chances of finding more than 3 raisins in a bun are
1-a

#Exercise 4: Normal distribution
#Consider a farmer who sells apples in wooden boxes.
#The weights of the boxes vary and are assumed to be normally distributed 
#with miu=15 kg and sigma^2=9/4 kg2. 
#The farmer wants to avoid customers being unsatisfied because the boxes are
#too low in weight. He therefore asks the following question: 
#What is the probability that a box with a weight of 10 to 15 kg is sold?
#Answer this question by making relevent calculations and by using pdf and cdf graphs.

#We need to calculate the probability that the box weights in between 10-15kg
#We can do that by calculating the probability that a box is less than 15 kg
#and than it is less than 10 kg and subsrtracting these values
#The probability that a box is less than 15 kg is a cdf at 15
b <- pnorm(15, 15, sqrt(9/4) )
b
#The probability that a box is less than 10 kg is cdf at 10
c <- pnorm(10, 15, sqrt(9/4) )
c
#and the probability that a box with a weight of 10 to 13 kg is
b-c

#Answer this question graphically generate a graph of pdf 
X1 <- seq(0, 30, length=100) #define values the wieght of the box may take
pdf_norm <- dnorm(X1, 15, sqrt(9/4) ) #calculate pdf for these values assuming N(15,9/4)
cdf_norm <- pnorm(X1, 15, sqrt(9/4) ) #calculate cdf for these value assuming N(15,9/4)

#plot the pdf
plot(X1, pdf_norm, type="l", lty=1, xlab="x value", 
     ylab="Density", main="PDF for N(15, 9/4)")

#plot the cdf
plot(X1, cdf_norm, type="l", lty=1, xlab="x value",
     ylab="Density", main="CDF for N(15, 9/4)")


#Exercise 5: Student's t distribution
# Display the Student's t distributions with 1,2,4 and 30
# degrees of freedom and compare it to the normal distribution

#Let's start with standard normal distribution
X2 <- seq(-4, 4, length=100) #define x values
pdfx <- dnorm(X2) #calculate pdf

par(mfrow = c(1, 1)) #set the plotting window to display one graph
plot(X2, pdfx, type="l",lty=2, xlab="x value",
     ylab="Density", main="Comparison of t Distributions")

#Now let's do the same for Student's t distribution
t1 <- dt(X2, df = 1) #calculate pdf
t2 <- dt(X2, df = 2) #calculate pdf
t3 <- dt(X2, df = 4) #calculate pdf
t4 <- dt(X2, df = 30) #calculate pdf

#colors and labels
colors <- c("red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "black")
labels <- c("df=1", "df=2", "df=4", "df=30", "normal")


#add these to the graph to st. normal

    lines(X2, t1, col="red", lwd=2)
    lines(X2, t2, col="blue", lwd=2)
    lines(X2, t3, col="green", lwd=2)
    lines(X2, t4, col="yellow", lwd=2)
    
#can also add legend
#define colors and labels
